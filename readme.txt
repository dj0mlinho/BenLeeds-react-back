- assign jobs to vendor - editJob (status + vendrId) && editVendor(calendar) && (optional) editWorkorder 
- check if workorder status should be changed




- solution for emailPassword hashing - one more field at login page
- email from admin to vendor should contain building address - workorder should contain building address field




- ISSSUES

for loop/ array.forEach do not modify/add/delete properties on objects returned from database ?
